### Project Description
Mood Menu is a playful web app that recommends dishes based on your current mood. Whether you‚Äôre happy, sad, or just bored, it will generate a completely random dish suggestion ‚Äî often questionable, always entertaining.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sometimes you don‚Äôt know what to eat, and thinking about it is exhausting. Mood swings make it even worse.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a mood-based random dish generator with ‚ÄúChef Mode‚Äù ‚Äî a robotic voice announces your food fate, making decision-making both easier and weirder.
